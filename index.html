    <p>Firstafall, Lets clear; There ae two branches is science:
    <ul>
      <li>Neurogenesis: Creation of new neurons.</li>
      <li>Neuroplasticity: Creation of connections between neurons.</li>
    </ul>
    There are two type of cells in brain:
    <ul>
      <li>Neurons</li>
      <li>Glial Cells</li>
    </ul></p>
    Brain is the most important organ in body.Each and every person who had done some great work had done with help of their brain, be it from Usain Bolt to Albert Einstein.
    <br><img src="/home/aman/Downloads/Neuron.png" alt="Neuron" width="30%">
  <p>Neuron comprises of dendrites,  nucleus, cell body, axon, myelin sheath, schwann cell and axon terminal.<br>
  The process of sending information from one neuron to anothe ris called synapses.
  Neuropalsticity is much broader than neurogenesis.For example, when we get out of
  our comfort zone to do anything the dendrite make more branches, connect with more
  neurons and when this happens the transfer rate of impulses increases rapidly.
<br>But over a period of time, when dendrite doesn't get that type of stimulus continously then
dendrite start shrinking down.People ahving disease like Amnesia are likely as dendrite is not able to find axon terminal,
the connections are not settling down and the information cannot be transmitted.<br>
When you make a new changes in your habit these dendrite branches form gradually
stable synapses connection with axon terminal.</p>
Fun Fact: When blind people practices learning with Braille; it is found that their
visual cortex in the brain lighten up.<br>
If a person hand get paralysed, it means that brain isnt giving it signal to act and that is due to disorder in neuron in their body.
<h3>Part of barain with abnormal size for a specific group of people:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hippocampus : for mugglers</li>>
  <li>Visual cortex: for jugglers, archer or who uses their eye very much</li>
  <li>Auditory corex: for musicians</li>
</ul>
<p>This states that over a period of time, our brain get adapt to new things.There is a rewiring in our brain depending on what we think
, what we do, what we try to learn and this all give new connections to neurons.This is basically called "Neuropalsticity"</p>
